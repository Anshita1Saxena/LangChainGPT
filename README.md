# LangChainGPT
This repository holds the LLM based project using huggingface and google open source language model.

We used here the following frameworks:
Streamlit:- Used to build the app.
LangChain:- Used to build LLM Workflow.
HuggingFaceHub:- Needed to use the open source model hosted in Huggingface by Google. This model is Flan-T5, which is an alternative of GPT-3. Flan-T5 is an encoder-decoder transformer model that reframes all NLP tasks into a text-to-text format. With appropriate prompting, it can perform zero-shot NLP tasks such as text summarization, common sense reasoning, natural language inference, question answering, sentence and sentiment classification, translation, and pronoun resolution.
Wikipedia:- Used to connect GPT to Wikipedia.
